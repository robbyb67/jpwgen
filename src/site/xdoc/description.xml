			The 'jpwgen' program is a Java-based password generator
			whose functionality resembles the popular 'pwgen' program.
			The *nix based version of 'pwgen' is available at
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/pwgen/. The basic idea is in
			generating passwords that although relatively easy to
			remember are secure enough for everyday usage. 'jpwgen' uses
			100% Java and is thus platform independent. It extends the
			'pwgen' functionality by the utilizing regular expressions
			for checking different types of conditions such as whether a
			password starts with a symbol or not. 'jpwgen' also supports
			blacklist and different types of secure random generators.
			It is also extremely useful as an embedded library that can
			be employed in the process of password generation against
			certain password policies. Please refer to the Javadoc for
			more information.
